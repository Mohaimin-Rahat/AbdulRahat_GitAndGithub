GitHub is a web-based platform built on top of Git. It adds collaboration and social features to Git repositories. Here are some key aspects of GitHub:

Hosting and Cloud Services: GitHub hosts Git repositories in the cloud, making it easy to store and share code with others. You can access your repositories from anywhere with an internet connection.

Collaboration: GitHub provides tools for collaboration, such as issues, pull requests, and project boards. Developers can discuss and track issues, propose and review changes, and manage project tasks efficiently.

Social Features: GitHub has a social aspect, with features like following other developers, forking repositories (creating your own copy of someone else's code), and starring repositories you find interesting.

Continuous Integration: GitHub offers built-in continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) capabilities through GitHub Actions, making it easier to automate software testing and deployment processes.
