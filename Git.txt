Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes to their codebase. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work. Key features of Git include:

Version Control: Git tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to view, revert, or compare different versions of your code.

Branching: Git enables developers to create branches, which are separate lines of development. This is useful for experimenting with new features or fixing bugs without affecting the main codebase.

Merging: Git allows you to merge changes from one branch into another when you're ready to integrate new features or fixes.

Local and Remote Repositories: You can work with Git repositories locally on your computer and push or pull changes to and from remote repositories, facilitating collaboration.
